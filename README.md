### How to support me?
I **really, really, really** appreciate your support as I do this work for passion and I don't make much out of it (only revenue is mere cents from Modrinth), so your support will be **greatly** appreciated and it will help do what I do, and make my life better. You don't need to give a lot, just whatever you can, will help make my life a lot better, and allow me to learn and thrive. Your support, its not just money, its a **belief**, it means someone, in the world **believes** in me & my work. That someone - its you. And I simply cannot say enough thankyous in my life, for your support. Your **belief** means I can continue, I can believe, and if I struggle, I can say to myself: **this person believed in me, I can do it**.
